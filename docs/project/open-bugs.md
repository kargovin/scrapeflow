## BUG-001 — Stale-pending recovery queries `WHERE jobs.id IS NULL` on every scheduler tick

**Severity:** Low (harmless, but noisy)
**Discovered:** 2026-05-12
**Status:** Open

### What happens

The scheduler's `_recover_stale_pending` loop (`api/app/core/scheduler.py`) selects all `job_runs` with `status = 'pending'` — including batch runs where `job_id IS NULL` (introduced by ADR-006). For each batch run it calls `await db.get(Job, run.job_id)` with `run.job_id = None`, which SQLAlchemy translates to:

```sql
SELECT ... FROM jobs WHERE jobs.id IS NULL
```

This query returns nothing, the `if job is None: continue` guard fires, and the run is skipped. No data is corrupted. However the query fires on every scheduler cycle (every 60s) for every stuck batch run in the DB, flooding the logs.

### Root cause

`job_runs.job_id` was made nullable in Phase 3 (ADR-006) to support batch items. The stale-pending recovery was not updated to exclude batch runs, which cannot be re-dispatched via the scheduler (no job template to build the NATS payload from).

### Fix

Add `JobRun.job_id.is_not(None)` to the stale-pending query in `_recover_stale_pending`:

```python
stmt = (
    select(JobRun)
    .where(
        JobRun.job_id.is_not(None),   # ← add this
        JobRun.status == "pending",
        JobRun.created_at < stale_cutoff,
    )
    .with_for_update(skip_locked=True)
)
```

Batch runs stuck in `pending` are not recoverable via this path anyway — their recovery would need to go through a separate batch-aware loop (Phase 4 candidate).
